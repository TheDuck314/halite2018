v14 5_zeta
final rank=6 mu=76.42 sigma=0.30 at 20181027 6:50pm

v15 6_eta
final rank=8 mu=77.25 sigma=0.74 at 20181027 10:28pm
smarter pathing with priorities
first pass at proactive dropoffs

v16 7_theta
final rank=4 mu=about 81 sigma=about 0.7 at 20181028 02:10am
very small update:
 - stupid ramming in 1v1s when enemy ship halite > my ship halite. this probably doesn't help
 - small tweak to mining target selection which produced like 99% winrate against 6_eta

v17 8_iota
final   rank=4 μ=79.91 σ=0.43 at 20181028 8:05pm
again a small update. these are only for two player games:
 - consider_ramming() doesn't ram an enemy unless there are 2 allies closer than the closest other enemy
 - pathing and mining consider enemies and adjacent squares passable if there are 3 allies closer than the 2nd closest enemy to that square
80% winrate against 7_theta in 2 player games
4 player should be unaffected

v18 9_kappa
final rank=3 μ=83.99 σ=0.89 at 20181028 10:14pm
another small update
- the logic that compares current-square halite and mining-tgt halite to decide whether to actually move accounts for inspiration
  this gave 95%+ winrate against Iota
- tiny bugfix where the thing generating the final collapse commands didn't account for not being able to move due to halite
I don't think anything else really changed
Note: I backported the 3 * here_eff_halite change to the local 9_kappa code, but it ran live with the older 5 *

v19 I think v19 was an accidentally reupload of v18
final rank was like μ=82.92 sigma=1.1

v20 10_lambda
final rank=2 μ=85.87 sigma=about 0.5
another small update
- condition for moving toward mining target is (tgt_eff_halite > 3 * here_eff_halite), down from 5 *. Tested well (but not like 99% winrate) against Kappa.
- possibly build ships until 140 turns left instead of 200 in 2p. Neutral in tests, but I've been stopping too early in live on big maps.

v21 10_lambda again
final rank=1 μ=86.72 σ=0.40 at 20181031 10:47pm
- when pathing, miners don't avoid returners whose dest square is more than 1 square away from the miner. not sure this really matters
- shift threshold to build dropoffs from 20 ships to 17 since I think I'm not building fast enough in live. this is
  clearly a bit better (like 75% winrate 2p, 40% 1st place 4p) against Kappa, but this is expected b/c of the avoid-enemy-structures
  logic in dropoff placement

v22 11_mu
final rank=1 or 2, μ=87.52 σ=0.43 at 20181101 11:31pm
- one thing I'm including even though self-play doesn't care: mild distance penalty for dropoffs, to discourage a really terrible one I saw in live
- rudimentary code for fleeing adjacent enemies in 2p games when we feel threatened. gives 90% winrate against Lambda. This is probably inflated since
  Mu's "should I flee" code is exactly the same as Lambda's "should I attack" code.

v23 12_nu
final rank=1 μ=89.25 σ=0.54 at 20181103 at 3:25am
- condition for passability/attack/flee is that # non-returning allies > # enemies in Manhattan radius 4
  this was 100% winrate against Mu in 2p

v24 13_xi
final rank=1 μ=90.52 σ=about 0.7? at 20181104 at 2:58am
- in 4p games, we observe whether each other player is too cautious to go next to enemy ships, and exploit the cautious enemies by
  allowing ourselves to move next to them. gives like 85% 4p winrate against Nu, but it's tuned against Nu so this may be optimistic.

v25 14_omicron
final rank=1 μ=91.67 σ=0.47 at 20181107 12:02am
- consider enemy structures impassable if that player has an adjacent ship
- when evading a returner, we never consider that returner's square as blocked
- returners don't consider Stuck ships as obstacles; if they end up pathing through one they just stay Stuck for a turn too
- returners find the lowest halite path that's also a min-distance path
- don't give two ships the same flee dest
- Flee is now its own purpose with higher priority than Mine
Test results against Xi with cautiousness-exploitation turned off in both:
    Omicron    2p:  67-17    4p:  77-38-39-21

v26 15_pi
final rank=1 μ=93.74 σ=about 0.6 at 20181108 12:15am
- crude combat late in 4p. With <= 100 turns left, consider enemies passable under some strict conditions. consider_ramming() is still not used in 4p.
  This gave 62-32-21-14 against Omicron.
- make more ships in 4p. requirement is ships * 2000 < halite left, down from 3500. Seems logical, looking at games. I was making many fewer ships in games I lost,
  and average profit/ship was like 2000 from the point where I stopped making ships, which seems too high.
  This gave 26-19-15-13 against Pi using 3500.


v27 16_rho
final rank=1 μ=93.29 σ=0.52 at 20181109 10:30pm
- hopefully fixed a silly bug where we could ram our own ship that was waiting to build a dropoff
- resolve_plans_into_commands() lets Purpose::Flee plans move onto "impassable" squares. This was 149-75 against Pi in 2p.
- slightly more 4p aggression, again via impassable and we_win_fight_4p().  41-35-29-23 against Pi in 4p

v28 17_sigma
final rank=1, μ=94.35 σ=0.83 at 20181110 1:43am 
- 4p aggression starts at 200 turns left instead of 100. Gives 30-15-8-3 against 100.

v29 18_tau
final rank=1 μ=95.16 σ=0.33 at 20181115 12:08am
- in 2p, we_win_fight() checks that we have a majority of ships within radius 8, up from 4. This gave 112-38 against Sigma.

v30 19_upsilon
final rank=1 μ=96.03 σ=about 0.45 20181116 12:48am
- returners alway consider enemy ship locations blocked for pathing. Didn't test this carefully but it has to be good based on what I seen in live.
  A thought: in 2p, this will look worse locally than in live, because locally enemy bots will flee if my returner considers a square passable, so there's
  little point in the returner avoiding enemies.
- when looking at a potential mining square's distance from base, we consider the planned dropoff point, if any, as a structure on par with the real ones
- we allow returners to return to the planned dropoff point, as long as there are enough returners already going back to get to 4000 halite
- returners pause on a square if doing so will net them at least 50 halite for the turn. didn't test this but something like this has to be good.
Against Tau: 2p:  254-140    4p:  277-191-148-137

v31 19_upsilon
final rank=1 μ=96.85 σ=0.41 20181117 10:20pm
- return thresh 1000 -> 950 
                       Upsilon.RETURN_HALITE_THRESH=900    2p:  16- 6    4p:  17-15- 7- 6
                       Upsilon.RETURN_HALITE_THRESH=950    2p:  13- 9    4p:  24- 7- 8- 4
                       Upsilon.RETURN_HALITE_THRESH=975    2p:  12-10    4p:  13-16- 4-10
                      Upsilon.RETURN_HALITE_THRESH=1000    2p:  25-41    4p:  77-93-112-111

v32 20_phi
final rank=2 (sort of) μ=95.73 σ=1.28 at 20181117 11:45pm
2p update:
- we_win_fight_2p is num_allies_within[8] >= num_enemies_within[8] with >= rather than > . This was a quite high winrate
  against Upsilon, not sure exactly the numbers. This is probably too optimistic since it's just exploiting the
  over-cautiousness of Upsilon.
- consider_fleeing: try to flee toward closest structure, not closest allied ship, and better system for resolving conflicts
  where two fleeing ships may interfere with each other. 385-122 against not doing this
Overall 2p:  219-37 against Upsilon

v33 21_chi
final rank=1 μ=97.44 σ=0.55 at 20181118 7:47pm
- we_win_fight_2p is back to num_allies_within[8] > num_enemies_within[8] for squares adjacent to an enemy ship that
  has less halite than us. 324-171 against Phi

v34 22_psi
final rank=1 μ=97.35 σ=0.89 at 20181118 10:28pm
- consider_fleeing operates in 4p mode too. It only flees when PlayerAnalyzer thinks a specific enemy ship may ram us.
  PlayerAnalyzer thinks a ship may ram us if
   - (this was actually bugged) that specific ship tried to ram someone last turn, or
   - that player has rammed a stationary ship of ours at least 3 times, and that specific ship has < 500 halite, and our ship has more halite than the enemy ship
  This is 83-27-21-8 and  100-69-25-16
 in another against Chi locally. One reason this might be inflated: the local opponent is cautious, so we rarely end up next
  to an enemy ship, unless they really are trying to ram, so there won't be too many false positives. But a reason for hope: if we face
  a true cautious opponent on the server, then PlayerAnalyzer will know they're cautious, and squares next to them will be passable, so
  we won't try to flee just b/c we're next to them, since we don't flee from passable squares.

v35 23_omega
final rank=1 μ=97.85 σ=0.46 at 20181120 9:05pm
- fixed a bug where we didn't actually properly detect whether a ship tried to ram the previous turn. now we'll
  flee ships that tried to ram last turn in 4p. Locally this is 115-97-97-93 against Psi, so basically noise, but
  fixing this seems like the right thing to do.

v36 24_omegaplusone
final rank=2 μ=97.07 σ=0.23
- silly thing: we_win_fight_2p is much more pessimistic with distance 2 of an enemy structure
- experimental: 2p: if you have >500 halite consider enemy ships impassable, and always consider enemy
  ships with less halite than you impassable. this is even, 152-160, against Omega; it's an attempt to
  lose less halite to teccles in 2p combat in live

v37 28_omegatimestwo
just played 11 games. rank=?? μ=100.90 σ=2.85
- MIN_DROPOFF_SEPARATION 17->9 2p:  52-58    4p:  79-49-53-50
- initial pass at dealing with SiestaGuru's dropoff blocking behavior

v38 29_omegasquared
final rank=2 μ=97.05 σ=0.90
- instead of requiring new dropoffs to be closer to any allied structure than any enemy structure, just require (dist to enemy structure > 4)
  against 28_omegatimestwo: 2p:  58-43    4p:  60-52-43-35
  NOTE: this change later got backported to 28_omegatimestwo, though 28_omegatimestwo did not use it live

v39 also 29_omegasquared
final rank=2 μ=97.64 σ=0.73
- tiny dumb thing: don't build dropoffs that are closer to an enemy SHIPYARD than they are to any of our existing
  structures. This is an attempt to fix this unfortunate game: https://halite.io/play/?game_id=2586352
  Even in local testing

v40 30_powomegaomega
- some performance optimizations that hopefully don't change any behavior
- in 4p, enemies with <300 halite are impassable (no improvement locally but seems intuitively good)
- in dropoff scoring, replace multiplier of (1 - 0.01 * dist_to_structure) with exp(-0.02 * mean_dist_to_my_ships) 
  Against 29_omegasquared: 2p:  93-70    4p:  127-86-66-61

v41 31_epsilon0
final rank=2 μ=99.00 σ=0.70
- don't set squares adjacent to enemy impassable if enemy can't move:
  against 30_powomegaomega: 2p:  488-429    4p:  481-474-422-432
- rudimentary blocking of enemies' final collapse. In 4p we block enemies within 5k profit+carried of us; in 2p we always block.
  All together, including the enemy-can-move change, against powomegaomega: 2p:  306-209    4p:  365-301-301-206

v42 32_gamma0
final rank=2 μ=97.56 σ=0.66
- plan_mining knows we're going for 950 halite instead of 1000. Probably slightly better
- 2p: instead of making enemies impassable and unrammable when their halite is less than ours, we add half the halite
  on the enemy's square to their halite so we can ram them when they're mining a good square. Didn't test this
Overall against 31_epsilon0:  2p:  358-303    4p:  374-356-340-281

v43 33_smallveblen
final rank=2    should figure out final mu+sigma, it was probably about 98.50 mu
- crude small bonus in plan_mining based on the avg halite near the closest structure. maybe helps a tiny bit: 2p:  376-341    4p:  397-369-349-325
- in 4p, a square currently containing an allied ship remains passable unless PlayerAnalyzer thinks an adjacent ship will ram
overall vs 32_gamma0:  2p:  294-290    4p:  404-364-330-265

v44 34_largeveblen
final rank=2 μ=98.61 σ=0.28
- 4p: # of ships for first dropoff depends on map size and is faster than the old 17 for maps smaller than 64x64
  also for 64x64 subsequent dropoffs are every 18 ships rather than every 20
Against 33_smallveblen: 174-123-107-97

45 36_predictor
highly experimental nn-based safety prediction in 4p
crashes with .so failures

v46 reupload of v44 34_largeveblen

v47 working upload of 36_predictor
final rank=2 μ=98.76 σ=0.44

v48 37_omega1
final rank=2 μ=99.76 σ=0.84
- don't send an explicit dropoff building ship, just wait for a returner to get there
against 36_predictor: 2p:  830-758    4p:  812-779-786-726  (so basically noise)

v49 38_aleph1
CHECK FINAL STATS
- plan_mining uses bfs distance (account for impassable) instead of naive manhattan distance for dist_from_me in square scoring
- MINING_DIST_FROM_ME_MULT 2.0 -> 1.75
Against Omega_1:  2p:  105-74    4p:  137-94-91-58

v50 39_aleph2
final rank=2 μ=99.68 σ=0.31
- MIN_HALITE_PER_SHIP_TO_SPAWN_4P 2000 -> 1500
  This is not based on any testing, but I've seen a lot of 4p 32x32 games where I seem to lose b/c I build too few ships,
  and looking at my final-profit-per-ship-count-at-last-built-ship shows it reliably over 1000, so let's try it
- remove the buggy incomplete final collapse blocking

v51 40_aleph3
final rank=2 μ=98.19 σ=0.45
- MINE_MOVE_ON_MULT in 4p 3.0 -> 2.5. Looks before for 4p but slightly worse for 2p
  one test:     182-131-110-99
  another test: 114-92-70-78
  (just did the change for 4p)

v52 40_aleph3
revert previous change: MINE_MOVE_ON_MULT in 4p back to 3.0, since live results were poor
