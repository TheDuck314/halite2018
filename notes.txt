NOTES ON COMBAT
- Rachol probably prefers to ram high-halite ships with low-halite ships, which does sound good
- Rachol is ramming late-game in 4p. And maybe prefers to ram the leader? Or at any rate strategically chooses who to go after

I think I really could benefit from
 - prefer to choose mining locations near good dropoffs
 - anticipate dropoff construction and rally there even before it's built. need to be careful that the halite to construct it actually gets delivered to the shipyard though
 - prefer to make dropoffs near miners

need to speed things up

when we get near to wanting to build a dropoff, bias our miners toward where it's gonna be chosen to go!

NOTES ON MINING
- The 2*dist_from_here part of the mining planning seems wrong. Why do we do worse when we make it 1*?
  Maybe it's because we neglect the halite cost of moving. We could model that explicitly!
- Similarly, the "tgt must have 3x halite to move there" logic seems wrong. Is it covering for the same issue?
- I'm pretty into the idea of computing halite cost to get to each square, and then adding that into the halite_needed for that square
- The factor of 0.7 in the naive_mine_rate is wrong if we'll actually fill up in 1 or 2 turns.
- Similarly, should the 3*here_halite thing depend on how close we are to filling up? maybe, if we're really close to full, we should relax it?

- the whole turns to fill up calculation assumes that the single square we are considering is representative of a whole region. but
  that's obviously false. we'll be overoptimistic about the total time if we're considering a square that has higher halite than its
  neighbors, and if we'll need to visit those neighbors to fill up.

- Idea: if a ship knows it's not going to fill up from its mining target, it should be able to reserve the best adjacent square,
  assuming no closer ship wants that square. Or, instead of the best adjacent square, what it thinks its mining target will be
  after it finishes its current square? can even do that with a sim.

- We may over-value near-to-us or near-to-base squares because we'll assume there are infinite other squares with the same
  dist_from_me and dist_from_base which may not be true (same as how we'll overvalue extra-high-halite squares b/c we'll
  assume there are plenty more where that one came from).

- A silly thing that can happen: a miner is staying still instead of moving to its tgt b/c of the here_halite vs tgt_halite logic,
  but a Returner wants to move through the miner, so the miner gets swapped further away from its tgt. Instead the miner ideally should
  just move toward its tgt, if possible. My original thinking here was that most likely the swap will bring you closer to your tgt
  on average, but it's not going to always be true.

I think consider_ramming (and maybe other stuff) overrides the final collapse, which is silly

Miners heading out shouldn't dodge around returners coming in just b/c the returner is moving onto an adjacent
square. Miner should just wait 1 turn and then probably swap places.

try breaking ties in mining tgt conflicts between ships by ship halite, or base distance, or whatever?

low-halite-pathfind to mining targets

tony maybe builds for longer in 4p? to 1000 halite/ship maybe?

in 4p, whether you should ram a ship depends heavily on a combination of its halite and time left. try this!

consider picking up halite on the way back

optimal ship stopping probably depends on map size? on small maps, everyone's probably inspired all the time and you can build later

figure out why so many ships got stuck in https://halite.io/play/?game_id=1529637&replay_class=1&replay_name=replay-20181107-071034%2B0000-1541574463-56-56-1529637

consider decreasing min-dist-to-enemy-dropff!

consider being more cautious about ramming near enemy structures

recent reasons for losing:
someone made a dropoff too near where I wanted one, so I built a really crappy dropoff instead
subpar fleeing?
getting deliberately rammed a lot in 4p late game

THIS SHOULD BE HIGH PRIORITY:
I really need to able to flee onto allies' squares by pushing them off

consider_fleeing() is attracted to the closest ally, but if that ally also needs to flee this could screw over that ally by stealing its spot!
Maybe need an iterated fleeing system like plan_mining.
It could maybe pre-resolve the case of "I want to flee onto an ally's square" so that resolve_plans_into_commands doesn't have to do that!
Or, maybe resolve_plans_into_commands is the right place

"Flee towards closest ally" is a pretty dumb heuristic

Every collision probably represents a mistake

can we be more assertive in 4p? change the "safety" threshold? fit a model offline or online to predict whether they'll move onto a given square?

my returners are ramming people on the way home at the end in 4p, which is idiotic
in general my returners gonna casually ram enemies I designate as "passable"?? that seems pretty wrong

Consider evasion in 4p. Might want to first write something to check whether a player has rammed in this game (not trivial)

in 4p, avoid collisions in the last few rounds before we'll need to collapse

probably something to be gotten by not ramming with high-halite ships

maybe need some repulsion in mining targets

dropoff distance penalty may be too heavy handed. or not heavy handed enough! tune it.

tune the bonus for returning to a richer dropoff

need some hysteresis in dropoff location choice

we need to not be so scared of recent enemy dropoffs

in 2p there's probably a lot of value in grouping -- at least, our low-halite ships
should be attracted to wherever the action is

consider tuning the parameter of when to stop making ships

consider tuning the min nearby halite to make a dropoff / min dist between dropoffs

min dist between dropoffs should logically be a function of halite density at the new dropoff
higher halite density justifes closer-spaced dropoffs (especially on smaller maps?)

in 4p, at the end, we can ram empty ships into whichever player is closest ahead of us (or closest behind us if we're winning)

I'm probably not building enough dropoffs on big 2p maps with a lot of halite

flee toward base, not allies?

don't ram when you don't have enough spare capacity nearby to pick up the halite?

maybe the advance dropoffs are bad because they're very far from the turtles and they have to 
spend tons of time getting there. that suggests there should be benefits from:
 - anticipating the dropoff location and preferring to mine near there
 - preferring to build the dropoffs closer to base, and closer to our ships

- when choosing mining target ships should take into account expected mining rate of *next* trip.
  that is, consider returning to all possible dropoffs, and consider the return time & expected next-trip mining rate,
  calculate an overall mining rate for each possible return, and max over them.

- think about whether our "halite rate" mining target selection is quite correct.
  it's neglecting the benefit of getting our already-held halite back to base earlier
  the benefit of that increases with the amount of halite we have (and with the usefulness of spawning new ships)
  so maybe there's room for a term that pushes for targets closer to base when we have lots of halite, and when we are still spawning ships (and is even higher early in the game?)
  would be sweet if we could figure out how to estimate numerically the time value of halite, whatever that means

- we could have the threshold for returning be lower when you're closer to base, since the time cost is lower

- we have a stupid thing where we choose a mining target that we don't know how to path to so we stay still

- returners shouldn't force miners to evade if they have a free path.

Rachol pre-sends his miners to where he knows he is going to build his dropoff.
I can do this too but I'd need to make sure I don't decide to place the dropoff somewhere else.
Also he doesn't just send his returning miners.


try the thing where we do a few iterations of mining target replanning with some repulsion
between the mining targets

we may want to send ships back at like 500 halite in the late game to reduce the risk of getting rammed with a full load

could hunt in packs!

if the ally currently mining a square is going to fill up before exhausting it, we could consider
it valid to have a second guy choose it as a mining target, using a lowered halite score

think more about preferring to mine near enemies in 4p games, even when there isn't instantaneous inspiration. there's an NAP-like idea here
